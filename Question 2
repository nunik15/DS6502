#Q2 In the year of 2005, which county had the highest rate of infected females for HIV?

#Import data into data R
I_dis <- read.csv("Infectious Disease 2001-2014.csv")

#Cleaning data
I_dis<- na.omit(I_dis)

#Filtering data
subset_female <- subset(I_dis, Year==2005 & Disease == "HIV" & Sex == "Female")

# Finding  the row where the maximum rate of HIV infection among females occurs
max_female_row <- subset_female[which.max(subset_female$Rate), ]


# Extract the county from the row
county_female_rate <- max_female_row$County
county_female_rate

#####
# Finding the row with the maximum population
max_pop_row <- subset_female[which.max(subset_female$Population), ]
max_pop_row

# Extract the county from the row with the maximum population
county_max_pop <- max_pop_row$County
county_max_pop

#Also, we can check correlation between these two variables
cor(subset_female$Rate, subset_female$Population)


ggplot(subset_female, aes(x = Rate, y = Population)) +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Rate of infected vs. Population",
